OSM Warden
==========
* need to research, discuss topic with others

general idea is:
To create a system of monitoring, developing, and validating OpenStreetMap data in a way that maintains that democratic spirit of OSM.

So there will be a hierarchy of places, ie.
World
--Region/Continent
----Country
( From this point on I think it will be good to experiment with different methods, have different systems for different countries decided by the mappers there)
------Province/State/Administrative Region
--------County/District/etc.  these will be different based on different countries
----------made up neighborhood boundaries

Function (tabs) of this system will be
- Monitoring (monitor the data in an area, ie changes etc.)
- Planning
- Export
- Analytics (charts and graphs)
- Printouts and webmaps (according to various themes)
