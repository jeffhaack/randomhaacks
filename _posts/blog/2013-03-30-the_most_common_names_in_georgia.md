Some time back I came across an <a href="http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2011/01/whats-in-a-surname/">interesting surname map of the United States</a>. I was particularly intrigued by the the way that the surnames were color-coded by ethnic background.

Having a particular affinity for the country of Georgia (aka საქართველო), I thought it would be interesting and educational to make a similarly styled map of the region.

Getting the data wasn't all that difficult. The national elections which took place in October 2012 were pretty darn free and fair, and the electoral commission did an excellent and orderly job of managing it all. This also meant that they had quite accurate voter lists, and every voter in the country listed with their district of registration. Some friends at <a href="http://jumpstart.ge">JumpStart Georgia</a> had been monitoring and mapping the results on election day, so they had already pre-processed a bit of the data. Long-story short, a few ruby scripts left me with a nice array of interesting data - the top surnames for each of the sixty-odd districts in Georgia.

Along the way I learned some interesting things. For example, that 6.4% of Georgian men are named Giorgi! This wasn't entirely surprising, as shouting "Gio!" in any populated place will surely elicit a great many responses, but having a quantifiable number is pretty cool.

I also found it interesting that the great majority of -idzes and -adzes are from the western part of the country, while the -shvilis tend to hail from the east. I'm sure any Georgian could have explained that beforehand, but it never occurred to me, those being the most commonly seen suffixes of surnames in the country.

While designing the map I started to realize that the suffixes of the surnames are directly linked to the ethnicity of the people - again, a thought which hadn't really occurred to me when I started. Sure there were the Georgians - idzes, adzes, and shvilis. Then you've got the -ias and -avas from Samegrelo, the -ianis of Svaneti, the Armenian -ians, and the Azeri -evis and -ovis, who must have Russified their names during Soviet times.

It's a beautiful hodgepodge of ethnicities, and it helps to remind that Georgia is not just for Georgians - it's a melting pot of peoples and cultures as rich as the history of the Caucasus.
